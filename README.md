# TheDISCREETAutoclicker

The DISCREET Autoclicker is an autoclicker with many convenient features, such as being able to control the clicking with *mouse* buttons, and being able to change its appearance on the taskbar, to disguise it as a different application! To use the autoclicker to the best of its ability, please read the entire "HELP FILE" below or in the "help" menu after install. For a TLDR, read the Changelog below.

-------------------------------------HELP FILE:------------------------------------
Click Interval:
Set the interval between clicks here. This autoclicker has been optimized for high accuracy and low lag: other autoclickers can't register intervals of less than 60 ms! This autoclicker can click with a timed delay anywhere from 1 ms to 1192:59:59.999 between clicks, or use the No Delay option to make the autoclicker click as fast as possible! Because the autoclicker is timed by the system clock, Click Intervals higher than the system clock tick rate are rounded to it. You can view the average click rate of the most recent set of clicks on the status bar (to view this, the click counter must be set to a finite number of clicks, not set to "Unlimited Times").

When the No Delay option is checked, the autoclicker does not use a timer and instead just clicks EXTREMELY fast (6000+ clicks per second)! For that reason, Click Randomness is disabled; likewise, there is not difference between the Single, Double, and Triple Click settings when No Delay is enabled.

Click Options:
You can select which mouse button you want the autoclicker to click, and what type of click to perform. Double and triple clicks are performed extremely quickly, so don't try to use them anywhere a delay is needed like "double-tapping" guns in a videogame: instead, use Click Repeat.

Click Repeat:
Unlimited Times will make the autoclicker run continuously between starting and stopping. (X) Times will make the autoclicker automatically stop after X number of clicks. Note that Single, Double, or Triple clicks are all each counted as one click. In other words, if you have Triple Click selected with Click Repeat set at 100, the autoclicker will actually click 300 times.

Hotkey Settings:
You can toggle the autoclicker with either a keypress (Keyboard Key) or a click (Mouse Button). The default hotkey is Pause|Break and the default hotclick is Left Click, but you can change them by clicking the respective "Change" button. Note that when in Mouse Button mode and "Unlimited Times" Click Repeat, you will not be able to set the hotclick button as the autoclick mouse button, and if it was selected previously, it will be replaced with a different mouse button when autoclicking.

Click Location:
You can set a specific location on screen to click at when the autoclicker is running by clicking Pick Location and clicking anywhere on screen. The default option is just to click whereever the mouse is.

Sneaky Options -- Window:
Available only in "The DISCREET Autoclicker", here you can change the header text (title bar text) of the window, and also the window's icon. Some popular text options are provided with buttons; click "SET" to set the text box text to the current window header text. For copyright reasons, no icon files are included for these, but you can use extractor programs to get icons (.ico) from your favorite programs and save them, then select them using "Change Icon...".

Sneaky Options -- Click Randomness:
Available only in "The DISCREET Autoclicker", here are options to randomize the clicking frequency to throw off autoclick detectors (human or otherwise). If Interval Randomness is enabled, every click will be the Click Interval plus or minus a random percentage of the Click Interval up to the chosen percentage value. This simulates natural human unevenness in click rate. If Random Stutter is enabled, there is a chance (as selected) per click of adding a random delay between 0 and the selected value in seconds. This simulates human overclicking, figeting, etc. that break up the evenness of spam-clicking.
